### 4. Architecture Diagram

![Architecture-Diagram](./assets/ArchitectureDesign.png)

The architecture of **Mi-CMS** is designed to ensure modularity, scalability, and AI-driven insights. Below is the high-level diagram of the system:

### üîç Key Components:

- **Authentication**  
  Google OAuth is used for secure login.

- **Dashboard**  
  Central control panel that interacts with all major services.

- **Customer Module**  
  Handles adding and managing customer information.

- **Order Module**  
  Lets users add customer orders.

- **Backend (Node.js)**  
  Acts as the main API server, orchestrating communication between the frontend, database, and AI services.

- **MongoDB**  
  Used to store all structured data like customers, orders, and logs.

- **Communication Logs**  
  Records customer interactions‚Äîeither manually entered or AI-generated‚Äîfor deeper insights.

- **OpenAI Integration**  
  Powers smart suggestions, insights, and personalized communication based on logs and customer profiles.

### 5. Summary of AI Tools and Other Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Built with **React** for a dynamic and responsive user interface.

- **Backend:** Developed using **Express** framework on **Node.js**, serving as the main API server.

- **Database:** **MongoDB** is used to store all structured data including customers, orders, and logs.

- **AI:** Integrated with the **OpenAI API** to provide smart suggestions, insights, and personalized communication.

- **CSS Framework:** **Bootstrap** is used for styling and to ensure a clean, responsive design.

### 6. Known limitations or assumptions

- **Does not work in browsers (like Brave) where third-party cookies are blocked.** Google OAuth and session management require third-party cookies to be enabled for authentication to work reliably.
- **Campaign audience is not updated when new customers are added to the database.** Once a campaign is created, its audience is fixed and does not reflect new customers who match the segment criteria.
- **No email/SMS delivery integration.** Communication logs are recorded in the system, but actual sending of emails or SMS messages is not implemented.
- **No role-based access control.** All authenticated users have the same permissions; there is no admin/user separation or granular access control.
- **AI-generated queries may require manual review.** The OpenAI-powered NLP-to-query feature may sometimes generate queries that need manual adjustment, especially for complex or ambiguous descriptions.
- **No pagination or performance optimization for large datasets.** The dashboard loads all customers and orders at once, which may impact performance with large data volumes.
